				`The project is a short 3-minutes video clip.
				The video is about to present a burning shelf full of books, in the middle of a empty field, in a countryside.
				This project deals with the subject of book’s disappearence nowadays and our relathionship with printing materials.
				By burning books, I evoke the fragility of books and papers throughout visual experimentation and strong visual and symbolic impact.
				The setting is clean and simple in order to highlight the fire and the books.
				I was inspired by the several ~« autodafés »~ during autoritary political movements such as Nazis or Islamic State.
				I used fire to effect people as much as possible.			
				I then mocked up the videos on screen, in order to create a simulation of how the project would look like in an exhibition.
				This video aim to be exhibited into art galeries, projected on big wide screens.

				and visual impact. The project include photographs of hands seeming like dancing like the dancers.
				The idea was to convey a feeling of strangeness and fascination as well as showing the beauty of dance.
				I worked with 3 hip-hop dancers, that I directed into a more abstract style.
